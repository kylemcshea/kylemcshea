# Hi there, I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a Full Stack Developer currently working for Intuit MailChimp, making web development even more accessible. I first dabbled into coding when I was 12, starting out with creating mods for Minecraft. Since then, I've had the fantastic opportunity to contribute to open-source projects such as FiveM and RedM.

Regardless of the day, no matter how busy I am, I make it a point to code at least one line every day â€“ to keep the momentum and to keep improving my skills.

As for inspirations in this vast field, I am a huge fan of the works of [Theo Browne](https://github.com/theo-browne), [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley), and [The Primeagen](https://github.com/primeagen).
